.SH NAME
dictionary \- recognize a pattern against a dictionary
.SH SYNOPSIS
dictionary [-h] <input text> <dictionaryfile> [-f][-s startingline]
.SH DESCRIPTION
dictionary takes as input a text (probably a sentence), then try to match it against the given dictionary (.dic) file.
On success, the program echoes the text (probably a command) associated with the pattern.
 
The dic file must respect a precise syntax.
Each entry is developed over two lines.
The first line is the pattern to be recognized, the second line is the corresponding command for output.
The first line can contain the following wildchards:

 \fB[\fRtext\fB]\fR
.RS 4
text is optional. Input text may contain it or not.
.RE
 \fB<\fRtext1\fB,\fRtext2\fB>\fR
.RS 4
Input text must contain one, and only one, among text1 and text2.
An arbitrary nuber of text1,text2,text3,... is allowed.
.RE
 \fB(WORD \fRname\fB)\fR
.RS 4
Input text must contain a single word. This word will be referenced as \fB$name$\fR
in the second line of entry.
.RE
 \fB(WORD<\fRany pattern\fB> \fRname\fB)\fR
.RS 4
Input text must contain an expression that match the mattern; all the expression will be included in \fB$name$\fR.
.RE
 \fB(LINE \fRname\fB)\fR
.RS 4
All the remaining portion of the sentence. Such text will be referenced as \fB$name$\fR
in the second line of entry.
.RE
 \fB{filename}\fR
.RS 4
This will match the string against the other dictionary filename, using option -f.
Experimental feature.
.RE

Wildchards can be nested.

The second line of the entry \fBmust\fR begin with a space or a tab. It can contain internal variables, denoted as \fB$variablename$\fR.
Internal variables will be replaced before echoing output.
If you want output the $ sign, for example for using a SHELL variable, type \\$.
A special variable \fB$SPEECH$\fR is provided for whole speech.

Between one entry and the following one, any number of empty lines is allowed.
Line beginning with a sharp are allowed, too, and will be ignored as comments.
Empty lines and comment lines are \fBnot\fR allowed between the two lines of an entry.

.SH OPTIONS
 \fB-h\fR
.RS 4
Show help
.RE
 \fB-f\fR
.RS 4
Allow matching of just first portion of speech.
.RE
 \fB-s\fR startingline
.RS 4
If a startingline is given, the search will begin from this line of the dic file. Program output will change:
two lines will be echoed, the command and the number of line of the match.
The intended use of this option is for looping over all the possible matches.
.RE
.SH EXAMPLES
